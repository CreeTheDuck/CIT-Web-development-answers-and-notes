<p>It’s been another tough weekend for Manchester United fans after their side failed to get a result from struggling Fulham, and there will be more than a few fans who are beginning to get a bit worried about where the team will finish.
Fear not, however, as one Donegal man has his eyes on the prize and plans on getting in touch with the Manchester club to offer his services as a troubleshooter and special advisor to David Moyes in order to help the club through this rough patch. He’s drafted up a letter that he plans to send to the folks in charge at United, but he first posted it to the Donegal Page on Facebook, looking for feedback before he sends it on.

There might be a few questions about his credentials, but the as yet unnamed fan has moved to clear up any doubts with a quick outline of what makes them qualified for the position, including some tactical expertise as displayed from a young age on the scubunto table soccer game, a high scoring season in the Milford & District Schoolboys league a few years back, and a good track record in the transfer market and league in Fantasy Football, where their team is currently perched in a respectable 665,143th position.
