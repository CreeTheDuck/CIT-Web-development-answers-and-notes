<p>I&#8217;m delighted to be presenting a workshop on <strong>Saturday March 15th 2014</strong> to female coders in Dublin who want to get started on &#8216;creative coding&#8217;.</p>
<p>Yes, <strong>female<em> </em></strong>coders. No guys allowed. Except as +1s with a female coder. It&#8217;s organised by <strong>Coding Grace</strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coding Grace is a collective of mainly female techs who provides language agnostic female-friendly coding workshops.</p>
<p>Currently Vicky Twomey-Lee is the main organiser, you can contact us via codinggrace@gmail.com.</p></blockquote>
<p>Vicky asked if I would deliver a workshop on Processing, and as a long time fan of teaching creative coding (to any gender) I was delighted to agree.</p>
<p>There is a small cover fee (not for me, I&#8217;m totally free, but the venue costs a little) and you get an entire day of live coding/project building with someone who has taught, developed &amp; exhibited with Processing for years.</p>
<h4>Schedule Outline</h4>
<blockquote><p>10:45 &#8211; 11:00 Registration<br />
11:00 &#8211; 11:10 Welcome &amp; Introductions<br />
11:10 &#8211; 12:00 Lesson 1<br />
12:00 &#8211; 12:30 Break<br />
12:30 &#8211; 13:30 Lesson 2<br />
13:30 &#8211; 14:30 LUNCH<br />
14:30 &#8211; 15:55 Lesson 3<br />
15:55 &#8211; 16:00 Closing &amp; End of workshop</p></blockquote>
<p>As you can see, it won&#8217;t be too intense, we&#8217;ll give you plenty of breaks and the focus will be on learning and having fun with code.</p>
<p>I am used to teaching groups of very different coding abilities (beginner to expert in the one room) so even if you are completely new to coding or an experienced coder, I will try to make this useful for you.</p>
<h3>Processing</h3>
<p>Processing is the ideal &#8216;first&#8217; language to learn for creative coders, and you can download and install it from <a href="http://www.processing.org">http://www.processing.org</a></p>
