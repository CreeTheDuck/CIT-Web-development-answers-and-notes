This archive contains all the sample SQL scripts listed in "SQL in easy steps" by Mike McGrath (3rd Edition).

To run these SQL script examples with the same command line instructions illustrated in the book Windows users should create a new directory folder at C:\SQL then place all the sample files in this archive into it. Linux users should do likewise with a directory at /home/user/SQL.
