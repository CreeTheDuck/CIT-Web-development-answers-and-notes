********* Users
In the users I control the every second image and make them float left and right.
I also center the text . I have the meda catches set for large screens, ipad and iphone screens.
For the smaller images  and media catches I use padding for the black around padding.
The rest is strign forword and kinda hard to right about :)


******************Gallery Effect 
The gallery effect is used by moving the slide part up - 300px; Then using on the hover to tranform it back to 0pxs with a 1 second speed.
 the use of over flow hidden makes it invisable to the user .
 
 I used the faded in keyframe to effect the fad in soical items. the effect chnages the oprcty from 0 to 1 :) at a rate 1s :)

 ************* For the menu
